# NewsApp
<br>
Hi guys!! I am joshita and this is the assignment project provided to me.
<br>
I have created a NewsApp with the help of React.js and firebase.So for authentication I have used google auth from Firebase for signin and signout.<br>
With the help of provided API I fetched the real-time data.<br>

# Features of NewsAPP: 
<br>
Toggle button for grid view and list view<br>
Created Favorite Articles which allows users to mark articles as favorites by tapping on a button.<br>

# State Managing Tools: <br>
I created a NewsContext using createContext from React. This context likely contains the state related to news articles and user information.<br>
 Used useState hook from React to manage local state within your components. For example, in NewsList.js, you have state variables like news, selectedArticle, etc.<br>

# Tech Stack:<br>
Javascript<br>
React.js<br>
Redux-Toolkit<br>
Css<br>
Axios <br>
Firebase<br>
styled-components<br>

# drawback of my project: <br>
Currently this project is still in process. There are several errors and bugs which I have to fix.<br>
But you can see my approach for the NewsApp.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
